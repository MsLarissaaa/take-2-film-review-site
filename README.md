### Take-2-Film-Reviews
  - Take-2-Film-Reviews is an application showcasing films which allows members
to create reviews for films. In addition to creating a review on a film, a
member also has the ability to rate a movie "good" or "bad", as well as place
a comment on a review that has been previously been made. Non members of
the application have the ability to see movie posters and descriptions as
well as see reviews and comments that have been made. Becoming a member of
the application is as simple as filling in a form with a few credentials. If
you are planning to join, and you are a member of another professional
film review publication, make sure to sign up with your industry email
domain to receive 'trusted reviewer' status. Enjoy.
