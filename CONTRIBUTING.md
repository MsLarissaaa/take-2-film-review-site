###Pull Request Workflow
- Create a branch including your name and the feature you are working on.
Remember to do this before you start writing code.
- Write code and test on the localhost to ensure for yourself that it is
working.
- Commit your code, writing a clear and concise commit message. Be specific,
but get to the point.
- Push the brancj to the Github repostitory.

###Code Review Workflow
- Inform another team member that you have made a pull request and would
like for it to be merged to the master copy in the repository.
- Another team mate should review the code along with you. If comments need
to be written, now is the time.
- Make sure that the reviewer understands the code being reviewed
before it is merged.
- Once merged, double check the localhost to make sure that the code is
still functioning as intended.
- Back in the Github repo, delete the feature branch.
